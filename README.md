# Deep Learning for HTTP DDoS Detection: A Comparative Study of Batch and Online Learning Approaches


This repository contains the code for Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, and preprocessing of the `BCCC-CIC-IDS2017` dataset for HTTP DDoS anomaly detection using deep learning algorithms.

Phase 1 focuses on a comparative analysis of batch learning and online learning for detecting HTTP DDoS attacks.

Phase 2 extends this comparison to the detection of zero-day attacks, evaluating the generalization capability of both learning approaches.

This code was developed as part of my MSc thesis.
